# Py6S #

Py6S is a Python wrapper around the [6S radiative transfer model](http://6s.ltdri.org/). This model is often used in remote
sensing and atmospheric sciences, and provides highly accurate results. However, it can only process
one band and one viewing geometry at a time. A number of applications require processing data for
multiple wavebands or viewing geometries, and this wrapper makes this easy.
