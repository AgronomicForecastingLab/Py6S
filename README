# Py6S #

Py6S is a Python wrapper around the [6S radiative transfer model](http://6s.ltdri.org/). This model is often used in remote
sensing and atmospheric sciences, and provides highly accurate results. However, it can only process
one band and one viewing geometry at a time. A number of applications require processing data for
multiple wavebands or viewing geometries, and this wrapper makes this easy.

For example, the code below sets up some parameters for the 6S model (the rest are left at their
default settings) and runs the model for all wavelengths from 0.4 to 0.8 micrometres and prints one
of the outputs.

	python
	import numpy as np
	from SixS import SixS
	
	model = SixS()
	
	for wavelength in np.arange(0.4, 0.8, 0.001):
		model.wavelength = wavelength
		model.run()
		
		print "Wavelength = %f \t Direct Irradiance = %f" % (wavelength, model.outputs.irradiance_direct)
