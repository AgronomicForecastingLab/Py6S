Roadmap
================================

The current release of Py6S has achieved the original aim of producing a Python interface to the 6S model, and it appears to be relatively stable. However, there are many plans for the future, including:

Soon
----
* Ability to import spectra for use as the GroundReflectance, rather than being limited to the predefined spectra provided by 6S. Importing of spectra should be possible from major spectral libraries (eg. the USGS and ASTER) as well as ENVI spectral library files (and maybe even field spectrometer data files?)
* Ability to link Py6S with the ProSAIL model to use ProSAIL outputs as inputs to Py6S

Medium-term
------------
* 

Eventually
----------
* A GUI interface allowing easier (but obviously far less flexible) use by those with no Python knowledge (particularly useful for teaching)
