Roadmap
================================

The current release of Py6S has achieved the original aim of producing a Python interface to the 6S model, and it appears to be relatively stable. However, there are many plans for the future, as listed below. If you have any comments on these plans - or want to suggest features that you'd really love to be included in Py6S - then contact me using the details on the :doc:`support` page.

Soon
----
* Ability to import spectra from ENVI Spectral Library files
* Ability to import radiosonde data from a wider range of formats
* Developments in the API for atmospheric correction, making it easier to atmospherically-correct multiple wavelengths using the same settings

Medium-term
------------
* (Possibly) A restructuring of the Py6S API to make it 'more pythonic' and better suited for future development.
* Ability to use Py6S (probably with a lookup-table) to perform atmospheric correction of satellite images.

Eventually
----------
* A GUI interface allowing easier (but obviously far less flexible) use by those with no Python knowledge (particularly useful for teaching)
