Roadmap
================================

The current release of Py6S has achieved the original aim of producing a Python interface to the 6S model, and it appears to be relatively stable. However, there are many plans for the future, including:

Soon
----
* Ability to import spectra from ENVI Spectral Library files
* Ability to link Py6S with the ProSAIL model to use ProSAIL outputs as inputs to Py6S

Medium-term
------------
* Ability to use Py6S (probably with a lookup-table) to perform atmospheric correction of satellite images.

Eventually
----------
* A GUI interface allowing easier (but obviously far less flexible) use by those with no Python knowledge (particularly useful for teaching)
